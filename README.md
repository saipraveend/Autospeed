# Autospeed - Automated vehicle speed management assisted with GPS

A system that is capable of over riding the driver’s control over the vehicle to maintain the speed in speed restricted zones. It uses a micro-controller to receive the GPS coordinates via bluetooth from an android phone running a custom application. A working prototype was tested on a Honda Activa.
